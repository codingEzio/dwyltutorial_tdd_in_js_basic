### Why

- For fun
- Tutorial link: [Learn Test Driven Development <small>(in JavaScript)</small> <small>(on github)</small>](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)

### Basics

- 3-step process
  1. write a failing test
     > understand the requirements/story well enough to write a est for what you expect
  2. make the test pass
     > write _only_ the code you need to make the <small>(failing)</small>test pass<br>
     > while ensuring your existing/previous test all **still** pass
  3. refactor the code you wrote
     > tidy up the code you wrote to make it simpler for yourself and colleagues to understand
